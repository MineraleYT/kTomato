# kTomato manual review checklist

Run these checks in a fresh user profile where practical. Record the application version, desktop environment, package format, and any failure with each review.

## Timer and presets

- [ ] Create a timer with a name, category, icon, work duration, break durations, and long-break interval. Save it and confirm the displayed values.
- [ ] Edit a user timer, duplicate it, select each resulting timer, and delete the duplicate.
- [ ] Confirm built-in timers cannot be deleted and can be reset to their defaults.
- [ ] Start, pause, resume, skip, and stop a work phase. Confirm the remaining time and phase label follow each action.
- [ ] Use short durations to cross a work-to-break boundary and a long-break boundary. Confirm the session count and next phase.
- [ ] Check automatic phase start in each supported mode, including disabled and breaks-only.
- [ ] Try the minimum and maximum supported durations, zero-length breaks, and a long-break interval of zero.

## Notifications and desktop integration

- [ ] Confirm phase-end notifications and sounds follow the selected timer's settings.
- [ ] Enable notification inhibition and screen-sleep inhibition during work, then verify both are released on pause, stop, and phase completion.
- [ ] Test ambient audio playback and volume, then disable playback and confirm it stops.
- [ ] Open the system-tray menu and verify timer controls, current phase, and show/hide behavior.
- [ ] Enable login startup and verify the desktop entry is created. Confirm the setting is reported as unavailable in Flatpak.
- [ ] Call the documented D-Bus `status`, `start`, `pause`, `skip`, `stop`, and `toggle` methods.
- [ ] Launch a second instance and confirm it activates the existing window instead of opening another database-backed instance.

## Data and statistics

- [ ] Complete and interrupt sessions; confirm completed and interrupted records appear with the correct durations.
- [ ] Check daily totals, targets, streaks, calendar navigation, and chart ranges across a day boundary.
- [ ] Export statistics to CSV. Open the file and check headers, quoting, non-ASCII text, and spreadsheet-formula-like values.
- [ ] Back up the database, change presets and history, restore the backup, and confirm both are restored.
- [ ] Try restoring an invalid or newer-schema backup; confirm it is rejected without replacing current data.
- [ ] Clear session history and confirm presets remain intact.

## Packaging and first run

- [ ] Install from the native build and from the Flatpak. Confirm the desktop entry, icon, About links, notifications, tray, and audio behavior.
- [ ] Launch with an existing database and confirm presets and settings remain available.
- [ ] Launch Flatpak with Wayland and X11 where available; verify audio, notifications, tray registration, and screen-sleep inhibition.
