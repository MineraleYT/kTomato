/**
 * Do Not Disturb through org.freedesktop.Notifications.Inhibit / UnInhibit.
 *
 * Why this and not Plasma's own "Do Not Disturb" setting: the inhibition belongs to our
 * D-Bus connection, so Plasma removes it when the application exits or crashes, and it
 * is independent of the user's manual Do Not Disturb. A setting written to
 * plasmanotifyrc would outlive a crash and would overwrite the user's own choice.
 *
 * The object is a small asynchronous state machine: it remembers what is *wanted*
 * and, one D-Bus call at a time, converges the server to it. That makes
 * release-while-acquiring, re-acquiring, errors and a restarting notification
 * service all fall out of the same two rules in sync().
