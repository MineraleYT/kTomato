 * (which stops the running phase) or edits the preset afterwards.
 *
 * Phases cut short by stop/skip are kept only if they lasted at least
 * kMinInterruptedMs, so accidental starts do not clutter the statistics.
 *
 * A session that cannot be stored (database busy, disk full...) is not dropped: it is kept in
 * memory and stored again at the next phase end or retry, and isSaveFailing() says so meanwhile.
