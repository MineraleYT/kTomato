 * Decides when notifications must be silenced and tells the NotificationInhibitor.

 * Rule: notifications are silenced exactly while the engine is *Working* and the current
 * timer has "Silence notifications while working" on. Every other state releases them:
 * Paused, Idle (stopped or a phase just ended), a break. The rule is re-evaluated on any
 * change of engine state, selected timer or timer options, so the durations always follow
